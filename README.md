Final projects for Earth System Modeling 2025 class (EAS4610)

Final projects involve using PDE numerical methods learned in this class (or methods related to those we learned in class) to model a process from a published scientific paper or textbook (for which the equations are know). The topic may involve reproducing or modifying models from published papers.
